EECS 325 Project 1

port: 5026
instructions: there are two java classes to compile, proxyd.java and ConnectionThread.java. So to compile call either
"javac *.java" or "javac proxyd.java ConnectionThread.java"
then to run the program just call 
"java proxyd -port 5026"
browser: I used firefox for this project. I set it up so firefox would use the proxy for normal HTTP protocol, not FTP,
SSL or any other protocols.
sites: some sites used where
case.edu
teamliquid.net
google.com
twitch.tv (this site caused problems because firefox kept sending CONNECT requests through the proxy)
